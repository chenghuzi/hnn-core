    "\n",
    "In order to understand the workflow and initial parameter sets provided with this tutorial, we must first briefly describe prior studies on the mechanistic origin of gamma rhythms, including our prior modeling work that led to the creation of the parameter sets you will work with [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Gamma rhythms can encompass a wide band of frequencies from 30-150 Hz. Here, we will focus on the generation of so called low gamma rhythms in the 30-80 Hz range. It has been well established through experiments and computational modeling that these rhythms can emerge in local spiking networks through interactions of excitatory cell and inhibitory cell interactions, with the period of the oscillation set by the time constant of decay of GABAA-mediated inhibitory currents [2–4], a mechanism that has been referred to as pyramidal-interneuronal gamma (PING). In normal regimes, the decay time constant of GABAA-mediated synapses (around 25 ms) bounds oscillations to the low gamma frequency band (around 40 Hz).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, PING rhythms are initiated by “excitation” to the excitatory (E) cells that causes spiking, which in turn synaptically activates a spiking population of inhibitory (I) cells. In turn, these I cells inhibit the E cells, preventing further E cell activity until the E cells can overcome the effects of the inhibition (~25 ms later). The pattern is repeated, creating a gamma frequency oscillation (around 40 Hz, 40 spikes/second). This general principle is schematically described in Figure 1 below. The frequency of the rhythm is paced by this time constant of decay of inhibition, which is mediated by strong GABA-A currents, as well as the excitability of the E cells (if the E cells are very excitable, they can fire before the inhibition has completely worn off, and the oscillation will be faster).\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-tutorials/master/gamma/images/image19.png\" width=\"500\"></img>\n",
    "<center>Schematic illustration of the circuit mechanisms underlying PING rhythms.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore the generation of PING rhythms in the HNN model. We will provide example parameter files and walk through simulations that generate low-frequency gamma activity in both Layers 2/3 and Layer 5, as in [1]. This tutorial relies on a different type of exogenous drive to “activate” the local network than the other tutorials. Here, the necessary excitation to generate spiking in the pyramidal neurons (E cells) that initiates the rhythm (see PING description above) is provided by a continuous train of action potentials with a Poisson distribution (Poisson Input) that activate post-synaptic excitatory AMPA synapses on the pyramidal neurons. This Poisson drive causes the pyramidal neurons to fire, dependent on the chosen conductance of the AMPA currents. The inhibition in the network is strong enough to overcome the Poisson drive and entrain the network spiking into a gamma frequency rhythm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of note, gamma rhythms can be generated by circuit mechanisms other than PING, including subthreshold rhythmic exogenous drive. Lee and Jones (2013) examined various mechanisms of generation of gamma activity and described ways to distinguish the mechanisms of generation based on features of current dipole signal [1]. After completing this tutorial, we encourage you to explore alternate mechanisms of gamma generation and to compare to your own gamma data."

In this example, the rhythmic dipole displays sharp downward deflections, reflective of the strong inhibition onto the pyramidal neuron somas, which pulls current flow down the dendrites.

They in turn synchronously activate the inhibitory basket neurons, which then inhibit the pyramidal neurons for ~20 ms, when the tonic drive outweighs the inhibition and the pyramidal neurons firing again creating a ~50 Hz PING rhythm. This type of synchronous rhythm is sometimes referred to as “strong” PING. Notice that there is also a ~90 Hz component to the dipole spectrogram. Inspection of the dipole waveform shows that this 90 Hz activity does not represent a separate rhythm, but rather reflects the dipole waveform shape which has a fast oscillation on each cycle of the slower rhythm, due to the strong downward currents induced by strong somatic inhibition on the pyramidal neurons."

However, simulation results can be compared to recorded data, as described in the ERP and Alpha/Beta tutorials. Follow steps 1-4 above using your data and parameter adjustments based on your own hypotheses.\n"
